Stanford ML course on coursera !

*Hints and tips*
###### Week 2 (ex1):
* Normal equation reads training data from the file, so feature normalization needs to be performed if it is to match gradient decent theta.
* Example data at the end of the ex1_multi script has to be normalized in order for it to match results in Y.
* Both of the mentioned tips are implemented.

###### Week 3 (ex2):
* Gradient descent is called with fminunc so there is no iterator in the function
* Ex_reg - features are extended with mapFeature for higher polynomial non-linear shapes
